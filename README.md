# Chatbot
Chatbot for tel communications 

This is a simple chatbot written in Python that uses the spaCy library to process natural language input and respond with pre-defined messages. The chatbot is capable of responding to greetings, inquiries about available services, and questions related to internet, TV, and phone plans.

**#Installation**
This code requires the spaCy library to be installed. You can install it using pip:
pip install spacy

You will also need to download the English language model for spaCy:
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm


**Usage**
To use the chatbot, run the script in a Python environment or IDE. The chatbot will prompt the user for input, and respond with a message based on the input.

The available responses are stored in a dictionary in the code, and can be customized or expanded as needed.
